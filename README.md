Fig. Side view of Conveyor and filling system

Here the conveyor and its support is shown along with guide rails used to guide the bottle straight to the nozzle, IR sensor is placed in perpendicular to the water nozzle. LCD Display is placed at the edge of the conveyor platform.

Fig. Top view of Arduino and other components

Here top view of the system shows the water pump and tube connection, Geared DC motor is connected to conveyor with a coupler. Arduino is connected with all sensor modules wires and LCD.



5.2 Bottle Capping Output

Fig. 5.3 Side view of capping system
Here the capping motor is in resting position i.e. 45°, holding the capping DC motor. Relay is in OFF state supply by 12v. Plastic header is a mould of bottle cap in which is used to rotate bottle cap.

Fig. 5.4 Slide view of capping process
Here the servo motor turns down to 90°, relay is turn ON therefore the DC motor starts rotates.
5.3 HMI Output  
Fig. 5.5 Web view of HMI
Thus the output of HMI of the system controlled and monitored by web after connected to the network. It consist of monitoring of system includes bottle detection, water pump and capping motor state ,time conveyor status and counter. Control of system is to start and stop the process with START/STOP buttons. Network details are also shown there.
